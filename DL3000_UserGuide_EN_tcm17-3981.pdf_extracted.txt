List Operation Function (List)
In list operation mode, you can perform the complex
current/voltage/resistance/power modes accurately and rapidly, which may be
synchronized with internal or external signals. In this way, you can complete the
sophisticated test.
In this mode, when receiving a trigger signal, the load will operate according to the
set execution mode and sequence. As shown in Figure 2-26, the load simulates the
complex sequences of input changes based on the list parameters that you edit. The
list function supports CC, CV, CR, and CP modes.

Figure 2-26 List Operation Function (List)
When selecting different trigger sources, you can generate complex sequences by
editing the setting value for each step, the dwell time, and slew rate (the slew rate
can only be edited in CC mode) to meet the complex test demands. All listed data is
stored in a non-volatile memory. It means that the data will not be lost when the load
is turned off.
Operation Procedures:
1. Power on the instrument
Press the Power key on the front panel to power on the instrument.
2. Connect the DUT and the channel input terminals of the load
Connect the DUT and the channel input terminals on the front panel of the load
as shown in Figure 2-2.
CAUTION
While making a connection, the positive polarity of the load should
be connected to the (+) terminal of the channel output, and the
negative polarity of the load to the (-) terminal of the channel
output. A misconnection with the terminals may cause damage to
the instrument and the devices connected to it.

Application Function
The load supports the following three application functions. Press APP to switch
among the three functions.
 OCP test function
 OPP test function
 Battery test function
OCP Test Function
OCP test principle (as shown in Figure 2-28)
When the OCP test starts, after the input voltage reaches Von, the load will delay for
a period, then starts to sink the current, increasing with incrementing steps at a
certain interval. Meanwhile, the load will compare the detected voltage value with
the OCP protection voltage value. If higher than the protection voltage value, the
load proceeds to run and increases with incrementing steps until reaching the
protection voltage.
If OCP occurs to the DUT, judge whether the current under test is within the
maximum and minimum current range. If yes, the load passes the OCP test. Digital
output of I/O interface on the rear panel is 0. If no, the load fails the test. Digital
output of I/O interface on the rear panel is 1.
If no OCP occurs to the DUT and the set protection time times out, the load
automatically stops sinking. The OCP test fails, and the test ends.

OPP Test Function
OPP test principle (as shown in Figure 2-32):
When the OPP test starts, after the input voltage reaches Von, the load will delay for
a period, then the DUT starts to work according to the starting power. The power
increases with increasing with incrementing steps at a certain interval. Meanwhile,
the load will compare the detected voltage value with the protection voltage value of
the OPP test. If higher than the protection voltage value, the load proceeds to run
and increases with incrementing steps until reaching the protection voltage.
If OPP occurs to the DUT, judge whether the power under test is within the set
maximum and minimum power range. If yes, the load passes the OPP test. Digital
output of I/O interface on the rear panel is 0. If no, the load fails the test. Digital
output of I/O interface on the rear panel is 1.
If no OPP occurs to the DUT and the set protection time times out, the load
automatically stops sinking. The OPP test fails, and the test ends.

Input Control
Turn On/Off the Input
Once you power on the load, it will not sink the current immediately, and you need to
press the ON/OFF key to control the input of the load. When the input of the load is
enabled, the ON/OFF key is illuminated. At this time, when the load reaches the
starting voltage (Von), the load starts to sink the current. Then, "LOAD" at the top of
the main interface is highlighted and active. When the input of the load is disabled,
the ON/OFF key is not illuminated. At this time, the load stops sinking the current.
Then, "LOAD" at the top of the main interface is inactive and grayed out.
Tip
Enabling or disabling the input does not affect the set values of the current
parameters.
Von Latch Function
When the load is used to test the power supply product whose voltage rises or falls at
a relatively slow rate, latched protection may occur. The load provides the Von Latch
function. You can set Von to control the sinking function of the load, thus protecting
the DUT. The starting voltage is set in CC, Battery, OCP and OPP modes. The default
unit for Von is V, and it ranges from 0 V to 150 V.
 Enable the Von Latch Function
When the input voltage is greater than the set starting voltage (Von), the load
starts to sink the current. When the input voltage decreases and reaches below
the set starting voltage (Von), the load will not stop sinking the current. As
shown in Figure 2-44.

Tip
If the load cannot sink the current, please check whether the starting voltage
(Von) has been set. If set, please set it to a minimum value.
Short-circuit Operation
The load can serve as a short-circuit system at the input terminal to test whether the
protection function of the DUT is normal when a short circuit occurs to the output
terminal of the DUT.
Press SHORT on the front panel of the load to cause the load to stay in
short-circuited state. At this time, the SHORT key is illuminated, which indicates that
short circuit function is enabled, and the load is in short-circuited state. "SHORT" at
the top of the main interface is highlighted and active. When the SHORT key is not
illuminated, short circuit function is disabled. At this time, "SHORT" at the top of the
main interface is grayed out and inactive.
When a short circuit occurs to the load in non-CC mode, it will automatically be
switched to its original mode. The maximum short-circuit current for
DL3021/DL3021A is 44 A; and that for DL3031/DL3031A is 64 A.
Note: Enabling the short circuit function in CV mode may cause the load to sink
large amounts of current, which may turn the input off.
DL3000 User Guide 2-79

--- PAGE 110 ---

RIGOL Chapter 2 Front Panel Operations
Tip
Turning the short circuit on does not affect the set values of the current
parameters, and the load will return to the previously set state when the short
circuit is turned off.
Trigger Operation
Trigger operation is commonly used in transient test function (Con, Pul, and Tog) and
List function. The load supports three triggering modes to allow synchronization with
other DUT. They are Tran trigger, Bus trigger, and DIGIO trigger. Before enabling the
trigger function, please select a trigger type first.
 Transient Trigger (TRAN)
In the local operation mode, press the TRAN key on the front panel, and then
one trigger operation is executed. At this time, "TRAN" at the top of the main
interface is highlighted and active.
 Bus Trigger (BUS)
When the load receives the remote triggering command (:TRIG:IMM) via the
interface, the load will perform one trigger operation.
 Digital I/O Trigger (DIGIO)
The digital I/O interface on the rear panel of the load can be used to receive the
external trigger signal. When the external trigger is in effect, the load will
perform one trigger operation once a low pulse is received over the trigger
terminal. The trigger output signal over the digital I/O interface can be used to
trigger an external device, such as a digital oscilloscope, an electronic load, and
other products.
Slew Rate and Minimum Transition Time
Slew rate is defined as the change in current, resistance, or voltage over time. It is
the speed of transition from one setting to another. You can set the actual transition
time from one setting to another by changing the slew rate. Figure 2-46 shows the
relationship between the set slew rate and the transition time. The slew rate
determines the minimum transition time between two settings. When the slew rate is
set to be a maximum value, it indicates that the transition time between the two
settings is the smallest.

Note: In case where the transition from one setting to another is large, the
minimum transition time can be calculated by dividing the current transition by the
slew rate. In case where the transition from one setting to another is small, the small
signal bandwidth of the load limits the minimum transition time. Due to the limitation,
the actual transition time is longer than the expected time calculated based on the
formula.
Tip
The actual transition time is defined as the time required for the input to change
from 10% to 90% or from 90% to 10% of the input values.

Protection Function
The load includes the following protection features: overcurrent protection (OCP),
overvoltage protection (OVP), overpower protection (OPP), overtemperature
protection (OTP), as well as local/remote reverse voltage (LRV/RRV) protection.
Once any of the above conditions is detected, the load will take the corresponding
protection measures and enter its self-protection mode.
CAUTION
To avoid causing damage to the load, the input voltage shall not
exceed the maximum rated input voltage, and the AC voltage is not
allowed to be connected to the load via the channel input terminals.
 Overcurrent Protection (OCP)
When the current that the load sinks exceeds the protection current, the load's
input will be automatically turned off and the load will stop sinking the current.
At this time, the beeper sounds, and a prompt message is displayed,
"Overcurrent protection, input disabled!" You can press OK to exit the prompt
message.
 Overvoltage Protection (OVP)
When the input voltage exceeds the protection voltage, the load's input will be
automatically turned off and the load will stop sinking the current. At this time,
the beeper sounds, and a prompt message is displayed, "Overvoltage protection,
input disabled!" You can press OK to exit the prompt message.
 Overpower Protection (OPP)
Overpower protection feature is mainly designed for protecting hardware. It
prevents the elements from being remained in the overpower state for a long
time, as doing so may cause the elements to quickly get aged or even damaged.
When the input power exceeds the protection power, the load's input will be
automatically turned off and the load will stop sinking the current. At this time,
the beeper sounds, and a prompt message is displayed, "Overpower protection,
input disabled!" You can press OK to exit the prompt message.
 Overtemperature (OTP)
The load has an overtemperature protection circuit. When the internal
temperature exceeds the safe limits, the load's input will be automatically turned
off and the load will stop sinking the current. At this time, the beeper sounds,
and a prompt message is displayed, "Overtemperature protection, input
disabled!". You can press OK to exit the prompt message.
 Reverse Voltage Protection (LRV/RRV)
When the polarity of input terminals (except the Sense terminals) and that of

the output terminals of the DUT are in wrong connection, the load's input will be
automatically turned off and the load will stop sinking the current. At this time,
the beeper sounds, and a prompt message is displayed, "Reverse connection!"
You can press OK to exit the prompt message.
Note: If the reverse current exceeds the rated current, the load may be
damaged.
CAUTION
To avoid causing damage to the load, when reverse voltage occurs,
you need to turn off the DUT and the load first, and then make a
right polarity connection.

RIGOL Chapter 2 Front Panel Operations
Sense Working Mode
When the DUT outputs great currents, the voltage drop on the load leads cannot be
ignored. To ensure an accurate measurement for the output voltage of the DUT, the
load provides Sense (remote sense) working mode.
In this mode, the Sense terminals are directly connected to the output terminals of
the DUT. Remote sensing compensates for the voltage drop caused by the load leads,
ensuring that the output voltage of the DUT is consistent with the input voltage of
the load.
Figure 2-47 shows the Sense connections on the front panel.

Chapter 2 Front Panel Operations RIGOL
Tip
 In case where the DUT outputs great currents, the load leads should be as
short as possible. You'd better twisted the leads to get optimum output.
 Twisted-pair wires are recommended for Sense leads, but you'd better not
twist the Sense leads with the load leads.

to be modified. It can be used to identify the instrument when you assign the IP
address to the instrument. A physical address is a 48-bit (6-byte) addressing
scheme, usually represented in Hex. For example, 00-2A-A0-A5-E0-56.
4. VISA
VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture), developed by NI (National
Instrument), provides an advanced programming interface to communicate with
various instruments through their bus lines. VISA enables you to communicate
with the instrument in the same way, without considering the interface type of
the instrument (such as GPIB, USB, LAN/Ethernet, or RS232). The instruments
that communicate with the PC via GPIB, USB, LAN/Ethernet, or RS232 are called
"Resources".
VISA indicates the resource name, which describes the name and location of the
resource. For example, when you use the LAN interface to communicate with
the instrument, the VISA descriptor is displayed as
"TCPIP::172.16.3.100::INSTR".

Remote Control via LAN
1. Connect the load to the PC
Use the network cable to connect the load to the PC or the local area network
(LAN) where the PC resides.
2. Configure network parameters
1) DHCP mode:
If the network supports DHCP, the DHCP server in the network assigns
network parameters (IP Address, Subnet Mask, Gateway and DNS) for the
load automatically.
2) Auto IP mode:
The load will automatically select the auto IP mode when any of the
following three conditions occur: 1) the network doesn’t support DHCP; 2)
DHCP mode of the load is disabled; 3) the load is connected to the PC
directly. After selecting the auto IP mode, it will acquire the IP address
ranging from "169.254.0.1" to "169.254.255.254" and subnet mask
255.255.0.0 automatically.
3) Manual IP mode:
Enable the Manual IP mode and disable the DHCP mode as well as the Auto
IP mode to set the network parameters manually.
If the load is connected to the PC directly, set the IP Addresses, Subnet
Masks and Gateways for both of the PC and the load. The Subnet Masks and
Gateways of the load and PC must be the same and their IP Addresses must
be within the same network segment (for details, refer to the TCP/IP
protocol). An example is shown in the table below.

Chapter 4 Troubleshooting
WARNING
Do not disassemble the instrument by yourself. Otherwise, you might be
exposed to the danger of electric shock. Any maintenance, adjustment or
replacement especially to circuits or accessories must be performed by
RIGOL authorized personnel.
WARNING
Only the exclusive power cord designed for the instrument and authorized
for use within the local country could be used. For replacement of the
power cord, please contact RIGOL.
This chapter lists the potential problems or failure, as well as the solutions in using
the instrument. If the following problems occur, locate and resolve the problems
according to the following steps. If the problems still persist, contact RIGOL and
provide your instrument information to us. (For instrument information, press
Utility  System.)
1. The instrument cannot be powered on.
(1) Check whether the power cord is correctly connected.
(2) Check whether you have pressed down the Power key on the front panel.
(3) Plug out the power cord, and check whether the voltage selector is in the
proper position, whether the fuse conforms to the fuse rating, and whether
the fuse is intact. For fuse replacement, refer to "Fuse Replacement".
(4) If the problem still persists, contact RIGOL.
2. An exception occurs when the load sinks the current in CC mode.
(1) Check whether the cable that connects the instrument to the DUT is
reversely connected, which causes the instrument to report the alarm for
reverse connection.
(2) Check whether the input power calculated based on the input voltage and
the current that the load sinks exceeds the power limit of the instrument,
thus resulting in overpower protection.
(3) Check whether the range of the load current is properly set.
(4) If the problem still persists, contact RIGOL.
3. An exception occurs to the input in CV mode.
(1) Check whether the cable that connects the instrument to the DUT is
reversely connected, which causes the instrument to report the alarm for
reverse connection.
(2) Check whether the maximum output voltage of the DUT is smaller than the
set load voltage.
(3) Check whether the DUT works normally.
DL3000 User Guide 4-1

--- PAGE 158 ---

RIGOL Chapter 4 Troubleshooting
(4) If the problem still persists, contact RIGOL.
4. An exception occurs to the input in CR mode.
(1) Check whether the output of the DUT is normal, e.g. check whether an
oscillation occurs to the DUT.
(2) Check whether the range for the resistance is properly set.
(3) If the problem still persists, contact RIGOL.
5. An exception occurs to the input in CP mode.
(1) Check whether the cable that connects the instrument to the DUT is
reversely connected, which causes the instrument to report the alarm for
reverse connection.
(2) Check whether the output of the DUT is normal, e.g. check whether an
oscillation occurs to the power supply; whether the rated power of the
power supply fails to reach the set power of the load.
(3) If the problem still persists, contact RIGOL.
6. An exception occurs to the transient feature test in CC mode.
(1) Check whether the cable that connects the instrument to the DUT is
reversely connected, which causes the instrument to report the alarm for
reverse connection.
(2) Make a real-time measurement for the CC slew rate. If the value failed to
reach the standard, shorten the leads between the DUT and the instrument
as much as possible, because the long leads will result in a slow slew rate.
(3) Check whether the range of the load current is properly set.
(4) If the problem still persists, contact RIGOL.
7. The USB storage device cannot be recognized.
(1) Check whether the USB storage device can work normally.
(2) Make sure the USB storage device used is FAT32-format Flash storage type,
as this instrument does not support hardware storage type USB storage
device.
(3) Restart the instrument and insert the USB storage device to check it.
